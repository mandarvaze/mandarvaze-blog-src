I read about [focus mate](https://www.focusmate.com/). Main principle is Human
Accountability. You start a video session with a stranger and just do your work.
This happens while the video camera is ON. I suppose just the fact that someone
is watching you, alone prevents you from procrastinating.

I can see it working for at least some personality types, for whom external
accountability matters more. (Obligers)
I assume people for whom internal accountability matters do not procrastinate at
all. (I may be wrong)

Then there are *rebels* (As per Gretchen Ruben's [personality
types](https://gretchenrubin.com/2013/01/four-personality-types-which-one-are-you))
who do not give a damn one way or the other. I suppose such people may not even
want to start a session.just because ...

I'm gonna try it. They have a few free sessions, just to try out.
