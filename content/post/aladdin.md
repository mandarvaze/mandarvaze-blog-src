![Aladdin](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Aladdin.jpg) 

Last night we watched live action "Aladdin" with the family - on TV.

First reaction - I liked the animated one better.
Second reaction - I liked the animated one better.

It might sound strange - but animated Aladdin and Genie actor "acted" better
than their live action counter parts.

Live action Jasmine (Naomi Scott) was better than the animated one.

They changed a story a little. I don't remember "throwing Ali into the water"
scene from the animated movie. 

When Jafar threw Aladdin "to the other side of the world" - it felt like he
was in "real" danger while watching the animated one.
In the live action one, not so much.

Final "battle" also seemed to matter in the animated movie when Jafar trapped
Jasmine in the time piece. Not so much in the live action.

Same with "Getting out of the Cave"

I think the difference may be watching in the movie hall (Animated) Vs TV

I did like the dance routines, and Prince Ali's parade. They looked awesome.

It might be unfair to compare Will Smith to Robin Williams - but Will Smith
had his moments. We laughed at couple of his jokes (which I don't remember
from the animated one)

None the less, Kids enjoyed this one a lot. Elder one remembered a little
bit of the animated one.
