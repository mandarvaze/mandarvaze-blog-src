These days book I'm reading -  [Keep Going](https://amzn.to/2QfOUbo) It has an entire chapter titled 

> You are allowed to change your mind"

He talks about how we are "afraid" to change our mind, as it (now a days) indicates "weakness".

Some interesting quotes from this chapter :

> I thought I was wrong about everything.
> I was wrong about that too.

> If youâ€™ve never changed your mind about something, pinch yourself; you may be
> dead.

> .. be open to possibility and allow yourself to be changed.

One of the problems I had when blogging was assigning Categories.

I can understand tags, there are usually a LOT (I assume that is expected.)
I assumed Categories need to be "limited" - Somehow I started using categories
and tags interchangeably. 

That did not make sense.

Initially (pelican, nikola) there used to be one category for a post (and
multiple tags)

But with hugo - even multiple categories are supported.

This added to (my) confusion.

I used to `grep` categories in the older posts so that I can use consistent
categories. It was painful.

It never occurred to me to completely get rid of them. Till now.

Initially I had Categories and Tags are menus, so that readers can find posts
that belong to specific taxonomy. But I am not sure how many regular readers I
have.

So starting with this blog, I've decided to not use categories for the new posts.

I've also removed Categories for the old posts.
