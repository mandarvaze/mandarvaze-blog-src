### History

This is probably *nth* incarnation of this blog.

I started with hosted wordpress. (Still available
[here](https://mandarvaze.wordpress.com))

Then I moved to self hosted wordpress, but I lost the access to it, due to my
neglegence (Read about it [here]({{< ref "/post/move-to-static-blog.md" >}}))

I was also on (now dead) posterous.

Finally I decided to move away from "hosted" blogs, and moved to SSG.

I started with pelican.

It took me a while to find a decent theme.

But it was no where near "cool" as other themes available for "Modern" SSGs

Since I had already used hugo for my [other
blog](https://learnings.desipenguin.com) - It was easy choice.

### Contents

Since the contents are accumulated over several blogs, it contains a lot of
variety. It does contain some "technical" posts, which I should probably move to
other blog.

I plan to use this blog to improve my writing.
