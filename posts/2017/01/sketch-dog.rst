I chanced upon *Times of India* from Jan 3rd, during a recent flight.
It had an article about "Hobbies to pickup in 2017"

It listed a few web sites about drawing. Two I noted down are :

* `Drawing Now <http://www.drawingnow.com/>`_
* `How to Draw <www.drawinghowtodraw.com/>`_

Both of them have youtube videos as well as Step by Step instructions.

The sketch above is from the first site.

The link above does not take you to the step-by-step page, instead takes you to
the page one can print, so that kids can color the dog. This is the one I used
for my drawing, not the step-by-step instruction.

Step-by-Step instructions are useful when sketching using a pencil (so that rub
off the guides). When sketching using either tablet, or marker (Like I do
otherwise) erasing the guides may be challenging, if not impossible.
