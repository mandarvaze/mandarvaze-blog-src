I drew on the Android tab after a long time. I usually draw on "paper" (more
about this elsewhere) and then scan it in.

I haven't perfected the "scanning" yet. I just take a photo using the android
phone, and do slight editing to make the image look a little better.

This time around, when I did that, I remembered the last `image
<http://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io/galleries/sketches/buddha.png>`_ I had drawn on
the tablet, and the "white" background was not anything like I could get using
"slight" editing of the "photographed" sketches.

So I decided to "go back" to drawing on the tab.

While the resultant image is much better, drawing on the "glass" surface is not
same as drawing on "paper" (On the other hand, it was much easier to "paint")

------

I do not want to a complex and time consuming "post-processing". Drawing these
pictures usually takes 10-15 minutes. I don't want to spend *more* time
post-processing than it took to draw the original drawing.

Feel free to suggest ideas to "scan" better, in comments.
