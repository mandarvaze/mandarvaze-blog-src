I started drawing again (seriously) after watching a youtube video of Graham
Shaw from TEDx Hull, where he teaches "everyone" to draw. One of the drawing
reminded me of the caricature of a "common man" made famous by eminent
cartoonist R K Laxman. I've been meaning to draw the "common man" ever since.

Today, when I went to my son's library, I came across this book about R K
Laxman, with few illustrations. Luckily, these days I carry my "portable"
whiteboard aka Inkinite notebook everywhere. I requested the librarian whether I
can spend a little time drawing sketches. She didn't mind. (Thanks)

Earlier, I had written about how my "scanning" using smartphone camera was not
generating good results.

Around that time, I read about scanning using "actual" scanner. So today, I
decided to just do that.

I had never used scanner with OSX (now macOS) since I purchased MBP. But that
turned out to be "no op"

I scanned this at 300 dpi and "Black and White" mode.

Saved the image as PNG (cause it is a lossless format)

File sizes were much better too. Around 300+ KB, as opposed to earlier ones
being in MBs.

I scanned three other sketches as well, and difference in the quality was
visibly better.
