*This is the first post in the series about my experience of my first ever Technical conference I attended. .. and I must say it was totally awesome !!*


**Road to PyCon**

I left Pune on Thursday - so that I can reach B'lore a day earlier. I had booked the tickets for 5.30PM MSRTC bus from Pune-to-B'lore. This was also the day when Ganesh Visarjan processions end. (In Pune the procession lasts more than a day) I reached Swargate a bit earlier to be safe. First thing I did was check the platform where the bus would come. Imagine my shock when I was told that the bus was cancelled !! First person told me that the bus "did not come from b'lore" I was asked to get a refund. While finishing the paperwork the person in-charge told that the bus is cancelled starting that day. The bus should make about Rs. 70k - per round trip, but was barely making 30-31k. Lucky for me, he also told me that there would be another KSRTC bus for b'lore in few minutes. Luckily, the 5PM bus was delayed (probably for me :)) The bus was barely 50% full. I got a good seat, and in minutes we left Pune. 

My PyCon Experience had started on exciting note !!
 
**Day 0**

I visited MSRIT a day before, so that I am on time for the keynote on Day 1. I was staying on old airport road, and did not have direct connectivity, so I had to travel till Majestic (or KBS as it is officially called) and take another bus from there. Turns out getting a "Day pass" works out better, since I had to travel 4-legs a day to and from pycon. Based on my few days experience I think that B'lore has a very good public transport system, when will Pune get similar public transport ? AC Volvo buses are a plenty, and other non-AC buses too. In fact PyCon India 2010 also suggested taking bus_  to the venue.

*Update:* Details of Day 1_  and Day 2_
