You need to understand this background to appreciate how a non-techy person would describe their experience with MS-DOS_ 


The other day, I was talking to her about the days (during my engineering college) when I used to work on DOS. Conversation went something like this.
 
*The text in parenthesis are my thoughts*, it isn\'t part of the actual conversation

 me: Do you know what is DOS ?
 
 her : Disk Operating System(wow, I didn't think she would know)
 
 me: How did you know ?
 
 her : I had to study about it, but all I know is the acronym (Thought so)
 
 her : Do you mean MS-DOS ? Ohh, I remember now, it was so boring(why boring ?)
 
 her : There were no colors, just a boring black and white screen (Hmm, you have been using computers only post-windows '95 days, no wonder you find DOS boring)
 
 her : All I remember is that it used to showÂ - **see, two dots, slanting line and greater-than-sign**

She was trying to explain the MS-DOS Prompt
